# RF-Propagation

This repository holds a tool based on the code of SPLAT! by John Magliacane, KD2BD http://www.qsl.net/kd2bd/splat.html
The source code came from https://github.com/jmcmellen/splat

The source has been signficantly modified and now has some significant differences from the original source.  As such it is incorrect to say that it is a variant of SPLAT! and is too different to be polite to make a pull request on the SPLAT! repository.
I respect that the SPLAT! source code is provided under GNU GPL v2 and so it is correct that this derived source version is provided by to the public domain under the same licence.

This is still a development in progress.  The inputs and outputs are likely to change over time as they are slowly converted to the formats that are convenient to me.  

I am not providing any garuntee or implication that the tool will meet any specific requirements and so I am am probably not going to be responsive to enquiries about its use or requests to add features.
